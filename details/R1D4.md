### - Create Strings using Template Literals

A new feature of ES6 is the template literal. This is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier.
Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.

### write concise object literal declarations using object property shorthand
```
const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x: x, y: y });

const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });
```

### - write concise declarative functions with ES6

```
// es5
const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello: function() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};

// es6
const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};
```

### - use class syntax to define a constructor function

ES6 provides a new syntax to create objects, using the class keyword.

It should be noted that the class syntax is just syntax, and not a full-fledged class-based implementation of an object-oriented paradigm, unlike in languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, etc.

```
// es5
var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){
  this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
}
var zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');

// es6
class SpaceShuttle {
  constructor(targetPlanet) {
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
}
const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```

### - Use getters and setters to control access to an object

```
class Book {
  constructor(author) {
    this._author = author;
  }
  // getter
  get writer() {
    return this._author;
  }
  // setter
  set writer(updatedAuthor) {
    this._author = updatedAuthor;
  }
}
```

### - Create a Module Script

ES6 provides an easy way to share code among the javascript files. This involves exporting parts of a file for use to one or more other files, and importing the parts you need, where you need them. In order to take advantage of this functionality, you need to create a script tag in your HTML document with a **type** of **module**

```
<script type='module' src='index.js'></script>
```

### - Use export to share a code block

### - Reuse Javascript Code Using Import

### - Use * to Import Everything from a file

```
import * as myMathModule from "./math_functions.js";
```

### - Create an Export Fallback with Export Default

a module only have one value to be a default export

```
export default function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

### - Import a Default Export

### - Create a Javascript Promise

Promise is a constructor function, so you need to use the new keyword to create one. It takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters - resolve and reject. These are methods used to determine the outcome of the promise

```
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

});
```

### - Complete a Promise with Resolve and Reject

A promise has three state: **pending**, **fulfilled**, and **rejected**

if there are not resolve and reject in a promise, the state always pending. Resolve is used when you want your promise to succeed and update the state to fulfilled. Reject is used when you want it to fail and update the state to rejected

```
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if(condition here) {
    resolve("Promise was fulfilled");
  } else {
    reject("Promise was rejected");
  }
});
```

### - Handle a Fulfilled Promise with Then

### - Handle a Rejected Promise with Catch

### - Using The Test Method

```
let myString = "Hello, World!";
let myRegex = /Hello/;
let result = myRegex.test(myString);
```

### - Match Literal Strings

```
let waldoIsHiding = "Somewhere Waldo is hiding in this text.";
let waldoRegex = /Waldo/; // Change this line
let result = waldoRegex.test(waldoIsHiding);
```

### - Match a Literal String with Diffrent Possibilities

Using alertnation of OR operator : |

```
let petString = "James has a pet cat.";
let petRegex = /dog|cat|bird|fish/; // Change this line
let result = petRegex.test(petString);
```

### - Ignore Case While Matching

Case is the difference between uppercase letters and lowercase letters. Example uppercase are A, B, C and lowercase are a, b, c. To ignore this case while matching, we can use **i** flag (*/i*)

```
let myString = "freeCodeCamp";
let fccRegex = /freecodecamp/i; // Change this line
let result = fccRegex.test(myString);
```

### - Extract Matches

we can extract the actual matches we found with the .match() method.

Note that the .match syntax is the "opposite" of the .test method you have been using thus far:

```
'string'.match(/regex/);
/regex/.test('string');
```

```
let extractStr = "Extract the word 'coding' from this string.";
let codingRegex = /coding/; // Change this line
let result = extractStr.match(codingRegex); // Change this line
```

### - Find More Than The First Match

To search or extract pattern more than once, we can use */g* flag. 

Note: we can have multiple flag on our regex */search/gi*

```
let twinkleStar = "Twinkle, twinkle, little star";
let starRegex = /Twinkle/gi; // Change this line
let result = twinkleStar.match(starRegex); // Change this line
```

### - Match Anything with Wildcard period

The wildcard character (.) will match any one character. The wildcard is also called *dot* or *period*. We can use the wildcard just like any other character in a regex. For example, if we want to seacrh hug, huh, huj, huk, we can use regex */hu./* to match all four words.

### - Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities

You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square (\[and\]) brackets.

For example, you want to match bag, big, and bug but not bog. You can create the regex /b\[aiu\]/g to do this. The \[aiu\] is the character class that will only match the characters a, i, or u.

```
let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
let vowelRegex = /[aeiou]/gi; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(vowelRegex); // Change this line
```

### - Match Letters of Alphabet

Inside a character set, you can define a range or characters to match using a hyphen character: -.

For example, to match lowercase letters a through e you would use \[a-e\].

```
let quoteSample = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
let alphabetRegex = /[a-z]/gi; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegex); // Change this line
```
