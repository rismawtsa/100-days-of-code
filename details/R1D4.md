## Javascript Algorithms and Data Structure > ES6

### Create Strings using Template Literals

A new feature of ES6 is the template literal. This is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier.
Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.

### write concise object literal declarations using object property shorthand
```
const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x: x, y: y });

const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });
```

### write concise declarative functions with ES6

```
// es5
const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello: function() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};

es6
const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};
```

### use class syntax to define a constructor function
ES6 provides a new syntax to create objects, using the class keyword.

It should be noted that the class syntax is just syntax, and not a full-fledged class-based implementation of an object-oriented paradigm, unlike in languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, etc.
