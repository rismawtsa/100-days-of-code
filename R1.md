### Day 5: January 14. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about Regex. It was a bit challenging going through the Restrict Possible Usernames step on FCC

**Summary**: [Regex](https://github.com/rismawtsa/freecodecamp-course/blob/main/JavascriptAlgorithmsAndDataStructure/Regex.md)

### Day 6: January 15. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
Still Learned about Regex. It is very challenging to solve some task. Need some resources to learn more.

Solved Step:
- Restrict Possible Usernames (very challenging, take hours to solve)
- Match Whitespace
- Match Non-Whitespace characters
- Specify Upper and Lower Number of Matches
- Specify Only The Lower Number of Matches
- Specify Exact Number of Matches
- Check for All or None
- Positive and Negative Lookhead
- Check For Mixed Grouping of Characters
